# GitHub Repository Setup Commands
# Copy and paste these commands in your terminal

# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd /home/lab2208/Documents/EE502/chapter6/SVM_Speaker_Classification

# 2. Initialize git repository
git init

# 3. Add all files
git add .

# 4. Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete SVM speaker classification analysis

- Performance comparison across 5, 10, and 20 speakers  
- Synthetic audio dataset with 400 total samples
- MFCC feature extraction with noise reduction
- Comprehensive visualization and reporting
- Reproducible results with validation scripts

Results: 100% → 60% → 42.5% accuracy as speakers increase"

# 5. Set main branch
git branch -M main

# 6. Add remote origin (REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SVM-Speaker-Classification-Analysis.git

# 7. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Alternative: If you have GitHub CLI installed, use this instead of steps 6-7:
# gh repo create SVM-Speaker-Classification-Analysis --public --description "Comprehensive SVM performance analysis for speaker identification" --push
